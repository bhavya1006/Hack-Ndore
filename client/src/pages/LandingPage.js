        A Smart Water Management System for Indore will install IoT devices, specifically water supply meters, to measure
        the amount of water consumed by average households. These meters will transmit data to a central server using low-
        power, long-range communication technologies like LoRaWAN or NB-IoT. The collected data will be processed and
        stored using cloud services, enabling scalable data management and analysis. AI/ML models will analyze water usage
        patterns to detect anomalies, predict leaks, and optimize distribution. Additionally, these models will help identify
        areas prone to high water usage, making predictions based on weather patterns and occasionally. <br/><br/>
        The system will feature a React-based dashboard for residents and municipal staff, providing real-time monitoring,
        detailed reports, and alerts for leaks. The dashboard will also include visualization tools to display consumption
        trends, distribution metrics, and user complaints. By leveraging IoT and AI/ML technologies, this system aims to
        ensure efficient water distribution, minimize wastage, and enhance the overall management of water resources in
        Indore.
